1. Amongst my fellow students two students report concerned me and I have few corrections which bothered me,
I would like to list them and want to describe issues related to those reports  ,

(i) As one of the student said about the banking application, I think only 30% of the solution will be provided and that will happen 
only from dollar to Indian currency conversion and all the banks are government authorised, I donâ€™t think the banks are going to 
give the authority to show up the resultant page of total tax deductions until and unless the user or 
a customer of the particular bank would login. So, the solution could be a third-party interface which will 
almost be like a client has to login and give a input and the background work should be regularly interacting with banks to get the 
calculations of the particular tax. After facing problem, I am discussing this issue.

type of situations there should be given genuine identification to the developers of any app or web page.
